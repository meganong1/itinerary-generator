# **Path Plan**

> An itinerary app using the Gemini API and Places API that allows users to generate personalized itineraries tailored to their interests.
> 

**Built with**: React, Firebase Cloud Firestore, Google OAuth, Tailwind CSS

**Background and Inspiration**

As I’m planning a trip with my friends, I found it a bit tricky since only a couple of us usually take on the organizing. It can be challenging to balance everyone’s preferences and budgets while using many different sites and apps to research food spots and tourist attractions.

**What it does**

Users can answer a few questions about their destination, budget, and travel companions, and the app will then generate hotel recommendations and a daily itinerary. They can get directions to each location, customize or change activities, and save their itinerary using Firebase Cloud Firestore.

**What I learned**

- Using React with Firebase Cloud Firestore and Google OAuth for storing itineraries.
- Using React Hooks to make API calls to generate itineraries that include photos.
- Hosting the application on Netlify.
